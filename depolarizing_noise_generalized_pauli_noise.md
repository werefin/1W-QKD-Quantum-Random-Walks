### Depolarizing noise and generalized Pauli noise

In quantum information theory, both the **depolarizing channel** and **generalized Pauli noise** are used to model noise in quantum systems. Below, we outline their definitions, differences, and formal expressions.

#### Depolarizing noise

The depolarizing channel models isotropic noise, where a quantum state is replaced with a maximally mixed state with a certain probability. For a single qubit, the depolarizing channel acts on a density matrix $\rho$ as:

$$
\mathcal{E}(\varrho) = (1 - p) \rho + \frac{p}{3} \left( X \rho X^\dagger + Y \rho Y^\dagger + Z \rho Z^\dagger \right)
$$

where $p$ is the depolarization probability and $X$, $Y$, $Z$ are the Pauli matrices. For a $d$-dimensional system, the depolarizing channel generalizes as:

$$
\mathcal{E}(\rho) = (1 - p) \rho + \frac{p}{d^2 - 1} \sum_{i \neq 0} P_i \rho P_i^\dagger
$$

where $P_i$ are the generalized Pauli operators.

#### Generalized Pauli noise

The generalized Pauli noise allows for asymmetric noise, where each type of Pauli error $X$, $Y$, $Z$ occurs with different probabilities. For a single qubit, the generalized Pauli noise acts as:

$$
\mathcal{E}(\rho) = (1 - p_x - p_y - p_z) \rho + p_x X \rho X^\dagger + p_y Y \rho Y^\dagger + p_z Z \rho Z^\dagger
$$

where $p_x$, $p_y$, $p_z$ are the probabilities of $X$, $Y$, $Z$ errors.

#### Key differences

* **Error probabilities**:
  - **Depolarizing channel**: all Pauli errors $X$, $Y$, $Z$ occur with equal probability ($\frac{p}{3}$ for qubits);
  - **Generalized Pauli noise**: each error type has independent probabilities ($p_x$, $p_y$, $p_z$).

* **Parameterization**:
  - **Depolarizing channel**: defined by a single parameter $p$;
  - **Generalized Pauli noise**: defined by multiple independent parameters ($p_x$, $p_y$, $p_z$).

* **Behavior in higher dimensions**:
  - **Depolarizing channel**: the noise is isotropic, and all generalized Pauli operators have equal probabilities;
  - **Generalized pauli noise**: allows for anisotropic noise with unequal probabilities for different Pauli-like operators.

#### Formal difference

The mathematical difference between the two channels lies in the probability distribution of the Pauli errors.

For a single qubit:

  $$
  \mathcal{E}_{\text{d}}(\rho) = (1 - p) \rho + \frac{p}{3} \left(X \rho X^\dagger + Y \rho Y^\dagger + Z \rho Z^\dagger \right)
  $$
  
  $$
  \mathcal{E}_{\text{p}}(\rho) = (1 - p_x - p_y - p_z) \rho + p_x X \rho X^\dagger + p_y Y \rho Y^\dagger + p_z Z \rho Z^\dagger
  $$

The difference is apparent when comparing the error probabilities, in fact for a depolarizing channel $p_x = p_y = p_z = \frac{p}{3}$, while for the generalized pauli noise $p_x$, $p_y$, $p_z$ are independent.

In conclusion, while the depolarizing channel assumes isotropic noise with equal probabilities for all Pauli errors, generalized Pauli noise provides a more flexible model by allowing asymmetric noise.
